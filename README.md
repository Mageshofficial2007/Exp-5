# Exp - 5 STUDENT ENROLLMENT SYSTEM

# AIM:
To draw the  StarUML diagram of student enrollment system .
# SRS (Procedure):
1 . Students create an account and log in to the system.

2 . Their data is verified and approved by the admin before generating a student ID.

3 . Students register for courses, and the system updates course details and study materials.

4 . The system monitors fee payments and allows students to write tests.

5 . Grades are generated automatically after evaluation.

6 . Reports are created and stored securely in the database for future reference.
